# fast stats NBA


## Project Description

It's a web app that makes it possibble to quickly access, the most important NBA league statistics data, presented in a conscise manner. 
Inspired by Google suggested snippet, that usually pops up when searching e.g. for "Dallas Mavericks schedule".

## My motivation

I'm form Slovenia, where currently very popular NBA player, Luka Dončić comes from. I tend to check his games regularly and the best way to
do it for me, is Google search snippet that presents only the most important data in a very clear way. I want to create a web app (eventually PWA) that I can bookmark 
and access NBA stats with a single click. 

## User interaction

On initial page there will be two ways to get results:
- Users will type their team name in a search form.
- Users will click on one of the presented teams.

The inital page wireframe with interaction possibilities presented is available at: https://wireframe.cc/7pgKGI

Further interaction on other pages will be possible with clicking on links.

## 3rd Party API(s)

I will be using:

- http://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/today.json

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

## Stretch features

- PWA
- 100% lighthouse score
- Settings persistence in the browser with Local Storage or IndexDB 

## Work process


- I will use project management tool trello https://trello.com/b/FWNtAX3f/fast-stats-nba
- Will try to commit my code every day.
- I will mostly follow existing simple design used in Google suggested snippet that serves me as inspiration, but will use https://wireframe.cc/ too.
