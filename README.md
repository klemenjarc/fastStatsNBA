# fast stats NBA


## Project Description

It's a web app that make it possibble to qickly access only the most important NBA league statistics data presented in a conscise manner. 
Inspired by Google suggested snippet that usually pops up when searching e.g. "Dallas Mavericks schedule".

## My motivation

I'm form Slovenia, where currently popular NBA player, Luka Dončić comes from. I tend to check his games regularly and for me the best way to
do it, is Google search snippet that presents only most important data in a very clear way. I want to create a web app (eventually PWA) so i can save it e.g. in bookmarks 
and access those data with a single click. 

## Users interaction

On initial page there will be two ways to get results:
- Users will type their team name in a search form.
- Users will click on one of the presented teams.

The inital page wireframe with interaction possibilities presented is available at: https://wireframe.cc/7pgKGI

Further interaction on other pages will be possible with clicking on links.

## 3rd Party API(s)

I will probably be using one of the following:

-https://www.balldontlie.io
-https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba/endpoints
-http://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/today.json

I haven't yet made final decision because those free NBA APIs may not have all desired features.

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

## Stretch features

PWA
100% lighthouse score
Settings persistence in the browser with Local Storage or IndexDB (maybe)

## Work process


I will use project management tool trello https://trello.com/b/FWNtAX3f/fast-stats-nba
Will try to commit my code every day.
I will mostly follow simple design used in Google suggested snippet, but will use https://wireframe.cc/ too.
